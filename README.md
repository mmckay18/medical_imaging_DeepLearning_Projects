# Introduction

This repo hosts medical imaging classification and segmentation projects to showcase my background in deep learning. I use X-ray, MRI, CT, and PET imaging data for these projects and have extensive training on using DICOM and NiFTI files.

# X-ray Classification

## Data

X-ray data source: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/rsna-pneumonia-detection-challenge/data

### Raw X-ray Image Data Visualization

_Figure 1: Raw training images used for X-ray pneumonia classification. These images are not normalized nor standardized. In this project, I have train and test directories with subdirectories 0 and 1 representing no pneumonia and pneumonia respectively The validatiion set is a fraction of the training set._

## Data Preprocessing

- Resize the images to 224x224
- Normalize intensity scale using sums of sums and sums squared
- Standardize the values by computing the mean and standard deviation of the sums and sums squared

### Normalization

I applied normalization by computing the sum and sum of squares of the pixel values for each image, where the normalizer 224Ã—224 accounts for the image resizing during training. The goal is to achieve a consistent intensity distribution across images ranging from 0 to 255.

#### **Sum:**

$$
\sum X = \sum_{i=1}^{N} \frac{\text{Processed\_dcm\_array}_i}{224 \times 224}
$$

#### **Sum of Squares:**

$$
\sum X^{2} = \sum_{i=1}^{N} \left(\frac{\text{Processed\_dcm\_array}_i}{224 \times 224}\right)^2
$$

### Standardization

I apply standardization to center the pixel values around 0 and scale them based on variance. First, I use min-max normalization to convert the pixel values from the range [0, 255] to [0, 1]. Then, I apply scaling to transform the pixel values to the range [-1, 1], by computing the mean and standard deviation from the sum of sums and sum of squares.

#### Mean:

$$
\mu = \frac{\sum X}{24000}
$$

#### Standard Deviation:

$$
\sigma = \sqrt{\frac{\sum X^{2}}{24000} - \mu^2}
$$

## Data Augmentation

I applied various augmentations that adjust orientation, scale, and shift to enhance the model's robustness in detecting pneumonia, regardless of the patient's positioning.
